# A Tuple is a collection of Python objects separated by commas. In someways a tuple is similar to a list in terms of indexing, nested objects and repetition but a tuple is immutable unlike lists which are mutable.

# coordinateY = 20.0;
coordinate = (10.0, 20.0) # With Tuple

print(name[0], name[4]) #Gives you a first element of string, -> and 5;
